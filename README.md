AlmostDNS
=========

Small program that will send an email to a given address if the current ip changes.

Writing this program to keep track of my external home ip address.
 
As it is almost impossible to get a static ip in the UK as a home
customer I decided to write a program that will send an email to a
given account each time my external IP address changes.
 
This program is inteded for use alongside a secure messaging app
server program that I will be writing.

Requires:   activation.jar
            additional.jar
            mail.jar
